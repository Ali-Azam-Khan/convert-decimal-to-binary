# convert-decimal-to-binary
Hi!
I wrote this piece of code to help people who want to convert decimal to binary in Javascript.
This is for learning purposes and I know there are lot of other and more optimal ways to achieve this task.
I'm looking forward to brilliant mind with creative ideas to improve every single line of this or any other code.
Thanks :)
